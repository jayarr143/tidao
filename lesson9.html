											<p>Well tomatoes or kamatis is also one of the easiest vegetable to plant in the Philippines. This kind of vegetables needs three to four months before you can harvest it.

Planting tomatoes is just like pechay. You need to grow the seeds first on a seed box and after that transplant it to its designated location after.In planting tomatoes, you need to plant the young tomato seedlings about two to three inch deep with a plant spacing of six to 12 inches apart.

After that you need to water it regularly especially when it is sunny. When you see that the soil is dry water it so that it will grow better.

Aside from that you need also to apply fertilizer as usual. You need also to care for tomatoes because some pest or insect might damage your plants. Monitor every now and then so that you can remove them immediately.

As times goes you will harvest tomatoes after three to four months. Tomatoes bear more fruits and it fast to ripen. You can harvest it when it is old enough and green in color. Try to avoid harvesting it when it is ripe if you are going to sell it in the market. But if for family purpose, you can harvest it when already ripe or orange in color.</p>
