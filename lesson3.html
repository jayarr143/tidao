							    <p>Our organic coconut oil project is at the heart of our activities in the Philippines. We work with over 2500 farmers who grow and harvest coconuts using traditional organic production methods. Once harvested, the organic coconuts are transported to a local processing facility where they are processed into high quality organic coconut oil (virgin, RBD, CNO). Our team of agronomists and quality staff work with the farmers and processing facility to ensure the highest level of quality, food safety and organic integrity. </P>

                                           <p> Our sourcing project in the Philippines is helping to supporting local farmers to improve their livelihoods. By assisting the farmers with technical support and organic certification, our farmers access organic premiums for their crops, a welcome supplement to their household incomes. In addition, our coconut project is Fairtrade certified, meaning that the farmers receive a Fairtrade premium on top of the organic premium. The Fairtrade premium is invested in different projects to provide finance and technical support to farmers. This enables the farmers to invest in increasing their crop production and to consider growing additional crops to diversify their income. </p>

                                            <a href="single-blog.html"><h2>The Future Of Coconuts</h2></a>
                                            <p>Today, the top coconut suppliers are struggling to meet the increasing demands of the global economy. Coconut has been a cash crop for decades and, even with stiff competition from other vegetable oils, it promises to continue to be a profitable venture in the future. Nonetheless, the top global coconut producers must learn from the current situation, and take steps to ensure that their farms are sustainable enough to stand the tests of time and meet future demands.

‘Fair Trade’ practices in the industry try to ensure that the benefits of the booming sector will trickle all of the way down to small farmers, but they unfortunately keep the production rates rising at a slower rate. Lack of investment in sustaining the coconut-growing land’s productivity, largely due to the high costs associated, mean that some farms are producing 75% less fruit than they did 30 years ago. The problem of insufficient supply to meet the increased demand is not helped by the fact that many of the trees producing coconuts today are over 50 years old, 20 years past their prime production years. According to APCC (the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community), many plantations across Asia are experiencing zero growth, and some are even ceasing production as their farmers switch their focus to oil palm production.

                                            <p>Coconuts' remarkable levels of resilience means that they can be grown in a wide variety of soils, although they do require a relatively high amount of rainfall. The natural habitat of coconuts is found in coastal areas and on the fringes of deserts. The coconut is a tropical tree species, mainly grown and harvested by small-scale farmers. Production of coconuts is concentrated on island and coastal areas, such as Fiji and Samoa, as well as in the humid tropics, such as India, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia.

The coconut is a very useful plant with a wide range of products being sourced from it. Coconut products are used to make everything from clothing to animal feed to beauty creams. Its kernel is harvested for its edible flesh and delicious water, while its husk is used for its strong fibers. Most important, however, are its oils, which are extracted, processed, and marketed for culinary, medicinal, and cosmetic uses alike. Typically, the flesh is first dried down to 6% moisture to make copra. This product is then hauled to factories across the world where it is manufactured into oil. Less widely used, but more valuable, “virgin” coconut oil is directly extracted from raw coconut.
